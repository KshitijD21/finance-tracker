- Match by amount (e.g., "$50" → expense with amount 50)
- Match by category (e.g., "food expense" → Food & Dining category)
- If says "last" or "recent" → pick most recent (highest index)
- If unclear, return expenseIndex: null

OUTPUT (JSON only):

  "expenseIndex": 5,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "message": "Deleted $12 Pizza Hut expense."
}

If can't determine which expense:
{
  "expenseIndex": null,

  "message": "Which expense do you want to delete? I found multiple."
}`;
